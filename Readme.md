# C++ Factory Example

This is a piece of c++ code I have shared with my co-worker over the years. It is an example
how a simple serializer and un-serializer can be built using macros and a flexible
factory implementation. It is basically a washed down version of the dynamic typing system
implemented in ET++. Hope it can give you all some new ideas (even though this is pretty
old stuff)
